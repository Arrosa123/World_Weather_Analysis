# World_Weather_Analysis
Analyze World Weather Data by Python APIs
# Project Overview and Purpose

- Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
- Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.
- Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server and store valuse from JSON array.
- Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.
- Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.

After working on PlanMyTrip app,beta testers can use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. And also able to pick their minimum and maximum temperatures for their trip destination.
